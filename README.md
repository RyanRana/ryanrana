I'm a 2nd year student at Watchung Hills Regional Highschool in NJ. Currently I am working on various STEM based research projects and applications.
My interest in software goes back to middle school when I was first introduced to it by a teacher at the school. Soon after, I found myself learning to code in Python and creating apps and websites for fun. I used my skills to build a handful of projects most of which you find on my website(linked below).  When I am not continuing to learn and build things, I like to teach and dicuss proggramming and technology topics through a series of articles. In short I like working on impactful projects that challenge my skills, I am looking to collaborate with equally passionate peaple. I am looking to get involved in an internship this summer. See ryanrana.github.io for my resume.
