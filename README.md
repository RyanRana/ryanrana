I enjoy unraveling concepts in computer science and learning by building, I have made many things from Chrome extensions to websites, mobile apps, AI algorithms, APIs, research papers, and fully deployed full-stack applications. I like growing my skillset and applying it to different types of projects.
<br><br>
I first discovered CS 4 years ago when I first saw a youtube video at school. I fell in love starting off with middle school EV3 programming, then Python, and building projects that I was interested in.
<br><br>
When I am not continuing to learn and build things, I write tech articles on Medium, hang out with my little sister, play basketball, and rewatch the Social Networks. 
<br><br>
I am looking to collaborate with equally passionate people.
