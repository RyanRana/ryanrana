          Hi! I'm Ryan Rana. I'm a 2nd year student at Wathcung Hills Regional Highschool studying CS and Statistics. Currently I am working on growing my startup, 
          <a href="https://courseturtle.com/">CourseTurtle</a>. CourseTurtle is a platform for students, teachers, and parents to share their course schedules within
           their school network.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interest in software goes back to middle school when I was first introduced to it by a teacher at the school. Soon after, I found myself learning to code 
            in Python and creating apps and websites for fun. I used my skills to build a handful of <a href="https://ryanrana.github.io/projects.html">projects</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I am not continuing to learn and build things, I like to teach and dicuss proggramming topics through a series of <a href="https://theryanrana.medium.com/">articles</a>.
            </p>
            <p>In short I like working on impactful projects that challenge my skills. You can find out a little more about what I've done by checking out my 
              <a href="https://ryanrana.github.io/index.html">website</a>.</p>
