Hi! I'm Ryan Rana. I'm a 2nd year student at Wathcung Hills Regional Highschool studying CS and Statistics. Currently I am working on growing my startup, CourseTurtle. CourseTurtle is a platform for students, teachers, and parents to share their course schedules within their school network.

My interest in software goes back to middle school when I was first introduced to it by a teacher at the school. Soon after, I found myself learning to code in Python and creating apps and websites for fun. I used my skills to build a handful of projects.

When I am not continuing to learn and build things, I like to teach and dicuss proggramming topics through a series of articles.

In short I like working on impactful projects that challenge my skills. You can find out a little more about what I've done by checking out my linkedin.
