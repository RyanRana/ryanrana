 Hi! I'm Ryan Rana. I'm a 2nd year student at Watchung Hills Regional Highschool in NJ. Currently I am working on a series of projects for highschool technology and STEM competions.

My interest in software goes back to middle school when I was first introduced to it by a teacher at the school. Soon after, I found myself learning to code in Python and creating apps and websites for fun. I used my skills to build a handful of projects.

When I am not continuing to learn and build things, I like to teach and dicuss proggramming and technology topics through a series of articles.

In short I like working on impactful projects that challenge my skills. You can find out a little more about what I've done by checking out my linkedin.
