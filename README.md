🦉 I am a rising junior at Watchung Hills Regional Highschool in NJ. I am a passionate programmer with vast expierence in Machine Learning and Web Design. Currently I am working on building a Haptic Device Prototype to simulate enviormental stimulus with Artificial Intelligence.
<br><br>
🐢 I have made many things from chrome extensions, to websites, to mobile apps, to AI algorithams, to reasearch papers. I like growing my skillset and applying it to different types of projects.
<br><br>
🗓 I started coding 4 years ago when I first saw it used in school. Soon after, I found myself learning to code in Python and creating apps and websites for fun. 
<br><br>
📺 When I am not continuing to learn and build things, I like to write tech articles on medium and rewatch the Social Network. 
<br><br>
👀 I am looking to collaborate with equally passionate peaple and get involved in an internship this summer.
